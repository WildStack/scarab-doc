Scarab Doc is written in react typescript and is a colaborative editing tool. To use it is very easy just enter your username which must be unqiue and thats it, more functionalities will be comming soon

Architecturally, client-side code communicates via WebSocket with a central server that stores in-memory data structures. This makes the editor very fast, allows us to avoid provisioning a database, and makes testing much easier. The tradeoff is that documents are transient and lost between server restarts


#### Named after `Glorious Scarab`
* Latin name: Chrysina gloriosa
* Habitat: Can be found in much of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico
* Size: About 0.98″ to 1.1″ long
* Colorful feature: It might seem strange to call a beetle “glorious,” but this one’s beautiful coloration justifies the name! Almost its entire body is covered in glossy, enamel-like green. It’s also marked with vertical stripes that are usually black or tan.
